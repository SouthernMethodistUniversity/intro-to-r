# The Basics

## R and RStudio

The programming language is called R and is fully open-source. The primary editor used to work in the R programming language is RStudio, which is a free product created by a company called Posit. You can either install R and RStudio on your computer, use Posit Cloud, or access via M3 (one of SMU's supercomputers).

### Install on your computer

To install R and RStudio on your computer, follow the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Be sure to install R first, and then install RStudio. You will never need to open the R installation because RStudio automatically finds your R installation. This option is recommended for those who will primarily be using the same computer and do not need the resources of a high-performance computer.

### Posit Cloud

Posit Cloud works in the browser with a free account. You can make an account and get started [here](https://posit.cloud/). This option is recommended for those who regularly use different computers and do not need the resources of a high-performance computer.

### Using RStudio on M3

In order to use RStudio on M3, you will need to be on a ColdFront allocation, which can be requested on your behalf by a faculty or staff member. For the purposes of this workshop, your instructor will have a ColdFront allocation made available to you. Once you have an active account, you can follow the instructions [here](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/hpc_docs/portal.html) and open an RStudio Server session. This option is recommended for those who need the resources of a high-performance computer for fields such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
