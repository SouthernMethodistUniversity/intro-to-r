You will never need to open the R installation because RStudio automatically finds your R installation. This option is recommended for those who will primarily be using the same computer and do not need the resources of a high-performance computer.",

For the purposes of this workshop, your instructor will have a ColdFront allocation made available to you. Once you have an active account, you can follow the instructions here and open an RStudio Server session.

From this panel you can import datasets into R, access your R scripts, and set your working directory. Your working directory is the base folder you want to operate in within an R session. Any filepaths or items saved in your environment will use your working directory as its base.\nTo set your working directory, navigate to the folder you want to be your working directory, click one More, and then Set As Working Directory. You can always change this, and we will discuss the best way to make use of a working directory in the Projects section below.\n\n2.1.2 Console\nIn the bottom left panel of RStudio, under the Console tab, is where you will execute all of your R code. Each line of code is prompted by the &gt; symbol. You do not need to type in the &gt;, it is simply to indicate a new line of code. To execute your code you will type out your code and hit the Enter key on your keyboard. Below is an example of how to add 2 numbers on the console. The details of this will be explored in future sections.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Scripts\n\n2.1.4 Environment\n\n2.1.5 Projects",
