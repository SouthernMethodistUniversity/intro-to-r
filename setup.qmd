## Accessing RStudio

The best way to write R code is in the RStudio editor, which is a free product created by a company called Posit. You can either install R and RStudio on your computer, or access RStudio in web browser using a free Posit Cloud account

### Install on your computer

To install R and RStudio on your computer, follow the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Be sure to install R first, and then install RStudio. You will never need to open the R installation because RStudio automatically finds your R installation.

### Posit Cloud (web browser)

Posit Cloud works in the browser with a free account. You can make an account and get started [here](https://posit.cloud/). This option is recommended for those who regularly use different computers and do not need the resources of a high-performance computer.
